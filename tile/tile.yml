  description: Splunk connection encryption & authentication
  markdown: |
    You can configure Splunk forwarding to use your own SSL certificates to ensure that your data is securely encrypted when in transit.
    This is not required for using the Splunk Nozzle but it is highly recommended.

    Follow Splunk documented instructions on [how to prepare your signed certificates into single PEM file](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.5.1/Security/HowtoprepareyoursignedcertificatesforSplunk) to be provided as `Client certificate` in this form.

    Refer to Splunk Docs for more background on [securing data from forwarders](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/6.5.1/Security/Aboutsecuringdatafromforwarders)

    On deployments with runtimes 1.8.9/1.7.29 and above,
    the built in user `splunk-firehose` will be used when no user is specified.

    API user is **required** for earlier versions of the Elastic Runtimes.
    Failing to specify the API user on versions without `splunk-firehose` will result in:

    ```
    unknown property "splunk_firehose_credentials"...
    ```

    See the docs for detailed instructions on creating a user.
